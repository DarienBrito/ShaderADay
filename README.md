# ShaderADay

1 shader (at least) per day, until I become somewhat proficient with the basics. Since my math sucks probably even after 1 year I will not be any good, but GPU power is too attractive not to give it 365 shots.

21-27th April -> Lost all these days due to unavoidable life commitments and sickness. However, I have resolved to integrate deliberately resting points every one month, as forgetting is key to learning! Resuming today (28th)
