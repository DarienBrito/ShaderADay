# ShaderADay

1 shader (at least) per day, until I become somewhat proficient with the basics. Since my math sucks probably even after 1 year I will not be any good, but GPU power is too attractive not to give it 365 shots.

## Update

Due to life I have been unable to code anything for almost a month in between June and July... is pretty hard to keep consistency but I'll do my best to keep in track!
