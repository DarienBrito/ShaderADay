# ShaderADay

1 shader (at least) per day, until I become somewhat proficient with the basics. Since my math sucks probably even after 1 year I will not be any good, but GPU power is too attractive not to give it 365 shots.

## Update mid-July

Due to life I have been unable to code anything for almost a month in between June and July... is pretty hard to keep consistency but I'll do my best to keep in track!

## Update end-July

Got my Pixel Spirit Deck by Patricio Gonzales Vivo! Time to reverse engineer all those patterns for fun!

## Update Augutst

It has been fun to observe how my way of seeing is transformed by trying to reverse engineer patterns. A quick glimpse to some of these figures is enough to know almost instantly to know how to code it in a shader. Could it be I'm getting better at this? Obviously these are very simple fragment shaders, nevertheless mastering the basics is the most important thing you ought to do when gaining proficiency in a new field... oh well... once I'm done with the pixel spirit deck I'll be back to where I left ray marching and see if this new insights translate well into that endevour. Coming week my buddy Tim G. will hopefully help me to get in track again with shaders in Touch Designer, a much delayed task... keep it coming.
